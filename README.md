## DOMod Demo - Currency Converter
[link](https://www.google.com)

This simple Currency Converter utilizes DoMod to execute API calls and render them on the page. The user can request to compare a base currency against a basket of currencies or compare between two currencies directly. API calls are made using DoMod's $l.ajax() function to fixer.io' JSON API and appended to a ul using DoMod's .append() method. DoMod's .find(), .attr() and .html() methods were also utilized to traverse the DOM and to dynamically add content .

See DoMod ReadME for further info about DoMod's capabilities: [DoMod Github](https://github.com/Elimor5/DOMod).
